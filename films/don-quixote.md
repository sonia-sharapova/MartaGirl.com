# Don Quixote

This short documentary about the Russian village "Zhary" where I spent each of my childhood summers was, unbeknownst to me, going to be my first and last opportunity to capture the essence of that setting.

It now exists as a document of a memory I desperately cling to, and a beautiful portrait of my dearly beloved grandfather, whom, due to the treacherous war enacted by a fascistic dictator, I was unable to say farewell to before he passed.

## About

This film serves as both a personal archive and a meditation on memory, place, and loss. Shot over several summers, it captures the rhythms of rural Russian life—the gardens, the gatherings, the quiet moments that make up a summer in the countryside.

My grandfather appears throughout, his presence anchoring the film with warmth and wisdom. The documentary became unexpectedly precious when circumstances made it impossible to return, transforming it from a casual family record into a vital document of a world I can no longer access.
