# Strings

This experimental film was a part of my thesis on strings, their knotted connection and proximity to language. The film was created using analogue methods; mini DV and hand-drawn animations on super 8 reels.

## Concept

The film explores strings as a metaphor for language—how meaning is knotted together, how communication creates connections and tensions. By using analog film techniques, the physical properties of the medium mirror the tactile, material nature of string itself.

The hand-drawn animations on super 8 reels create a sense of fragility and impermanence, while the mini DV footage grounds the abstract concepts in tangible reality. Together, they form a meditation on how we weave meaning through language and gesture.
