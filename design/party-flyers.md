# Party Flyers

Making flyers is something I love to do because not only does it create an identity for an event, but it harkens back to a time when sharing a piece of design work was necessary to get the word out. I think it brings a sense of dignity and identity to even the smallest get together.

## Approach

Each flyer is designed to capture the unique spirit and energy of its event, using a mix of digital and analog techniques. I draw inspiration from vintage concert posters, punk zines, and contemporary graphic design to create pieces that feel both nostalgic and fresh.

The physical distribution of these flyers becomes part of the event experience itself—a tangible artifact that connects people to a moment in time.
