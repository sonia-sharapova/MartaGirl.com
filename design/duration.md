# Duration

This was an experimental design project to play with the durational experience of flipping through a book. It featured four chapters, separated by an intermission, including a photo essay about time, an interview with a professor of Deleuze, an original essay on Henri Bergson, and a final taxonomy of objects and scenes that hold time.

## Concept

The book itself becomes an exploration of duration through its physical form. The pacing of content, the weight and texture of different paper stocks, and the rhythm of page turns all contribute to creating an embodied experience of time passing.

## Details

- **Format:** Perfect-bound book, 120 pages
- **Dimensions:** 8" × 10"
- **Paper:** Mix of weights and textures to emphasize chapter transitions
- **Typography:** Custom typographic system reflecting temporal themes
- **Year:** 2022

The project investigates how the book as medium can create a durational experience—how time feels different when engaged with physical materials versus digital scrolling.
