            <p>Marta Sharapova is a playful and flirtatious young woman who everyone should meet. She is a designer, a filmmaker, an actress, a critic, a poet, a barber, and a gifted portrait artist. She studied at Pratt Institute and has a Baccalaureate (with the Highest of Honors!) in Typographic Design with minors in Philosophy, Art History, and Comparative Literature.</p>
            
            <p>A daughter of the cinema, she has watched nearly 2700 films. If you asked about her favorite books, she would likely say "Petersburg" by Andrey Bely or "The Recognitions" by William Gaddis.</p>
            
            <p>In her personal work, her process is often centered around analogue media, a habit formed from volunteering at the Filmmaker's Cooperative in Manhattan. In her free time, she plays the latest indie video games on her PC, goes to the movies, and cooks elaborate meals for her fiancé.</p>
