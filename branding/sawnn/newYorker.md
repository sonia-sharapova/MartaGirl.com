## Concept

The branding needed to honor both The New Yorker's iconic visual identity and Swann's elegant aesthetic. I developed a design system that referenced the magazine's distinctive typography and illustration style while maintaining the sophistication expected of a premier auction house event.

The color palette drew from vintage New Yorker covers, using muted tones and pops of signature red. Typography mixed classical serif fonts with the magazine's characteristic hand-lettered style, creating a bridge between past and present.
