# Swann Auction Galleries

My current role at Swann Auction Galleries puts my “jack of all trades” promise to the test every day! From directing photoshoots for centerfolds to designing 150+ page catalogues, the trust my colleagues have granted me is something I take very seriously. This is my most fulfilling professional opportunity to date, and I am grateful to be constantly surrounded by erudite specialists. I take extreme care to reflect the polish and dignity that this historic auction house brings to each and every one of their pursuits.
